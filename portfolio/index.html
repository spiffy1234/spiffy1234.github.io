<main class="intro">
    <p>Hello! I'm Srishti Kumari, a B-Tech student specializing in Computer Science at Birla Institute of Technology,
        Mesra. I am passionate about technology and aspire to become a Full Stack Web Developer. Currently, I am
        focusing on
        learning frontend/UI development, with a keen interest in frameworks like React, and honing my skills in backend
        technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and databases like MongoDB.</p>

    <p>I enjoy building web applications that are intuitive and user-friendly, and I believe in delivering high-quality
        solutions that improve the user experience. Besides coding, I have a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence
        and
        Machine Learning and hope to incorporate these technologies into web development in the future.</p>

    <p>As I continue to learn and grow, I aim to work on challenging projects that enhance my skills, and collaborate
        with a
        team of like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology.</p>

    <p>In addition to my academic journey, I am also involved in various personal projects and internships, which have
        given me practical exposure to real-world development practices. These experiences have not only improved my
        technical
        knowledge but also taught me valuable lessons in communication, teamwork, and problem-solving.</p>
